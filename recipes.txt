- Custard tart:
    - 190g flour
    - 120g butter
    - 55g sugar
    - 1 egg

    Will have slight bit leftover custard
    - 600g milk
    - 7 yolks
    - 90g sugar

    1) flour + butter cornmeal, 2) sugar, mix well, 3) egg, bring together,
    flatten and refridgerate ~1h (easier to smooth into muffin tray)
    4) beat yolks + sugar, slowly add warm milk (not boiling), beat to bubbles

- Pasteis de nata (Paul Hollywood)
    - 150g plain flour
    - 85g butter
    - 50-75ml chilled water
    - pinch salt

    - 340g whole milk
    - 40g flour
    - 180g sugar
    - 165ml water
    - 6 large egg yolks
    - (opt) 1tsp vanilla / cinnamon

    - NOTE: might still be too much custard? Try reducing another ~5-10% (still
      6 yolks)

    1) flour + salt, + 25g butter -> breadcrumbs, just enough water to dough
    2) roll out dough, grate 30g butter over bottom 2/3, one turn, grate 30g
    more butter, one more turn. 2x more turn w/ fridge. Shape
    3) custard: milk + flour, warm until thicken, dissolve sugar in water, boil
    until 106-112C, whisk sugar into warm milk, whisk into yolks.
        - Can all-in-one milk + flour + water + sugar, will not get rising
          custard in the oven, no ridges in final product
    4) cool custard, then fill (~1cm below top) and bake, 475F 15-18 minute
        - 16min at 480 just started charring, lots of rise, try even higher
          temp?
