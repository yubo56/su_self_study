# minimizer
Exercises in numerical minimization.

## Done:
- Newton's Method minimizer

## TODO:
- Polynomial fitter
- F-test implementation to determine what degree polynomial needed to fit data

## Wishlist:
- Conjugate grad descent (do reading first, maybe not worth)
- Genetic algorithm implementation?
