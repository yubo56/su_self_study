# Introduction

Starting a food log for myself, but an app is too hard. Will just be a basic
python script for now, may consider extending so I don't have to be at a
computer to log

Should support omitting nutrition facts, omitted = 0.

Wishlist:
- Interface for adding foods/inputting
- Web UI
- Plotting abstractions?
