# Graphics

So far two projects will go in here:

1. Simple raytracer: Get graphics basics down, following Caltech class at http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/advcpp/
2. Various graphics algorithms: I want to implement algorithms for some common image-manipulation techniques, such as resizing, blending etc. Will be loosely following http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15462-s15/www/ for guidance.
